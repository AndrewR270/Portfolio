## Current Programming Projects

I am a member of [CSES Dev](https://csesucsd.com/about) and am on the **Open Source** Team.
The project I am currently a part of is *Opportune*, which is a career networking and readiness website.

As a personal project, I am developing the game **Casus Belli** in the **Unity Game Engine**.
It is a board-game like *grand strategy simulator* focusing on various periods in world history. Potential
plans include adding local play and multiplayer features.
